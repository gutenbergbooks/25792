<br />
SYMPATHY OF RELIGIONS.</h1>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p class="center">BY THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%;" />

<p>Our true religious life begins when we discover that there
is an Inner Light, not infallible but invaluable, which
&ldquo;lighteth every man that cometh into the world.&rdquo; Then we have
something to steer by; and it is chiefly this, and not an anchor,
that we need. The human soul, like any other noble vessel, was
not built to be anchored, but to sail. An anchorage may, indeed,
be at times a temporary need, in order to make some special
repairs, or to take fresh cargo in; yet the natural destiny of
both ship and soul is not the harbor, but the ocean; to cut with
even keel the vast and beautiful expanse; to pass from island on
to island of more than Indian balm, or to continents fairer than
Columbus won; or, best of all, steering close to the wind, to extract
motive power from the greatest obstacles. Men must forget
the eternity through which they have yet to sail, when they
talk of anchoring here upon this bank and shoal of time. It
would be a tragedy to see the shipping of the world whitening
the seas no more, and idly riding at anchor in Atlantic ports;
but it would be more tragic to see a world of souls fascinated
into a fatal repose and renouncing their destiny of motion.</p>

<p>And as with individuals, so with communities. The great
historic religions of the world are not so many stranded hulks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
left to perish. The best of them are all in motion. All over
the world the divine influence moves men. There is a sympathy
in religions, and this sympathy is shown alike in their
origin, their records, and their progress. Men are ceasing to
disbelieve, and learning to believe more. I have worshiped in
an Evangelical church when thousands rose to their feet at the
motion of one hand. I have worshiped in a Roman Catholic
church when the lifting of one finger broke the motionless multitude
into twinkling motion, till the magic sign was made, and
all was still once more. But I never for an instant have supposed
that this concentrated moment of devotion was more holy
or more beautiful than when one cry from a minaret hushes a
Mohammedan city to prayer, or when, at sunset, the low invocation,
&ldquo;Oh! the gem in the lotus&mdash;oh! the gem in the lotus,&rdquo;
goes murmuring, like the cooing of many doves, across the vast
surface of Thibet. True, &ldquo;the gem in the lotus&rdquo; means nothing
to us, but it means as much to the angels as &ldquo;the Lamb of God,&rdquo;
for it is a symbol of aspiration.</p>

<p>Every year brings new knowledge of the religions of the
world, and every step in knowledge brings out the sympathy between
them. They all show the same aim, the same symbols,
the same forms, the same weaknesses, the same aspirations.
Looking at these points of unity, we might say there is but one
religion under many forms, whose essential creed is the Fatherhood
of God, and the Brotherhood of Man,&mdash;disguised by corruptions,
symbolized by mythologies, ennobled by virtues, degraded
by vices, but still the same. Or if, passing to a closer analysis,
we observe the shades of difference, we shall find in these varying
faiths the several instruments which perform what Cudworth
calls &ldquo;the Symphony of Religions.&rdquo; And though some may
stir like drums, and others soothe like flutes, and others like violins
command the whole range of softness and of strength, yet
they are all alike instruments, and nothing in any one of them is
so wondrous as the great laws of sound which equally control
them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amid so much war and contest and variety of opinion,&rdquo; said
Maximus Tyrius, &ldquo;you will find one consenting conviction in
every land, that there is one God, the King and Father of all.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
&ldquo;God being one,&rdquo; said Aristotle, &ldquo;only receives various names
from the various manifestations we perceive.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sovereign
God,&rdquo; said Cleanthes, in that sublime prayer which Paul quoted,
&ldquo;whom men invoke under many names, and who rulest alone,
... it is to thee that all nations should address themselves, for
we all are thy children.&rdquo; So Origen, the Christian Father,
frankly says that no man can be blamed for calling God&rsquo;s name
in Egyptian, nor in Scythian, nor in such other language as he
best knows.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>To say that different races worship different Gods, is like saying
that they are warmed by different suns. The names differ,
but the sun is the same, and so is God. As there is but one
source of light and warmth, so there is but one source of religion.
To this all nations testify alike. We have yet but
a part of our Holy Bible. The time will come when, as in
the middle ages, all pious books will be called sacred scriptures,
<i>Scriptur&aelig; Sacr&aelig;</i>. From the most remote portions of the
earth, from the Vedas and the Sagas, from Plato and Zoroaster,
Confucius and Mohammed, from the Emperor Marcus Antoninus
and the slave Epictetus, from the learned Alexandrians
and the ignorant Galla negroes, there will be gathered hymns
and prayers and maxims in which every religious soul may unite,&mdash;the
magnificent liturgy of the human race.</p>

<p>The greatest of modern scholars, Von Humboldt, asserted in
middle life and repeated the assertion in old age, that &ldquo;all positive
religions contain three distinct parts. First, a code of morals,
very fine, and nearly the same in all. Second, a geological
dream, and, third, a myth or historical novelette, which last becomes
the most important of all.&rdquo; And though this observation
may be somewhat roughly stated, its essential truth is seen
when we compare the different religions of the world side by
side. With such startling points of similarity, where is the difference?
The main difference lies here, that each fills some blank
space in its creed with the name of a different teacher. For
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
instance, the Oriental Parsee wears a fine white garment, bound
around him with a certain knot; and whenever this knot is undone,
at morning or night, he repeats the four main points of
his creed, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To believe in one God, and hope for mercy from him only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To believe in a future state of existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To do as you would be done by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus far the Parsee keeps on the universal ground of religion.
Then he drops into the language of his sect and adds,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To believe in Zoroaster as lawgiver, and to hold his writings
sacred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creed thus furnishes a formula for all religions. It might
be printed in blank like a circular, leaving only the closing name
to be filled in.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> For Zoroaster read Christ, and you have Christianity;
read Buddha, and you have <ins class="correction" title="Budhhism in original">Buddhism</ins>; read Mohammed,
and you have Mohammedanism. Each of these, in short,
is Natural Religion <em>plus</em> an individual name. It is by insisting
on that <em>plus</em> that each religion stops short of being universal.</p>

<p>In this religion of the human race, thus variously disguised,
we find everywhere the same leading features. The same great
doctrines, good or bad,&mdash;regeneration, predestination, atonement,
the future life, the final judgment, the Divine Reason or
Logos, and the Trinity. The same religious institutions,&mdash;monks,
missionaries, priests, and pilgrims. The same ritual,&mdash;prayers,
liturgies, sacrifices, sermons, hymns. The same implements,&mdash;frankincense,
candles, holy water, relics, amulets, votive
offerings. The same symbols,&mdash;the cross, the ball, the
triangle, the serpent, the all-seeing eye, the halo of rays, the
tree of life. The same saints, angels, and martyrs. The same
holiness attached to particular cities, rivers, and mountains.
The same prophecies and miracles,&mdash;the dead restored and
evil spirits cast out. The self-same holy days; for Easter and
Christmas were kept as spring and autumn festivals, centuries
before our era, by Egyptians, Persians, Saxons, Romans. The
same artistic designs, since the mother and child stand depicted,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
not only in the temples of Europe, but in those of Etruria and
Arabia, Egypt and Thibet. In ancient Christian art, the evangelists
were represented with the same heads of eagles, oxen,
and lions, upon which we gaze with amazement in Egyptian
tombs. Nay, the very sects and subdivisions of all historic religions
have been the same, and each supplies us with mystic and
rationalist, formalist and philanthropist, ascetic and epicurean.
The simple fact is, that all these things are as indigenous as
grass and mosses; they spring up in every soil, and only the
microscope can tell them apart.</p>

<p>And, as all these inevitably recur, so comes back again and
again the idea of incarnation,&mdash;the Divine Man. Here, too, all
religions sympathize, and, with slight modifications, each is the
copy of the other. As in the dim robing-rooms of foreign
churches are kept rich stores of sacred vestments, ready to be
thrown over every successive generation of priests, so the world
has kept in memory the same stately traditions to decorate
each new Messiah. He is predicted by prophecy, hailed by
sages, born of a virgin, attended by miracle, borne to heaven
without tasting death, and with promise of return. Zoroaster
and Confucius have no human father. Osiris is the Son of God,
he is called the Revealer of Life and Light; he first teaches
one chosen race; he then goes with his apostles to teach the
Gentiles, conquering the world by peace; he is slain by evil
powers; after death he descends into hell, then rises again, and
presides at the last judgment of all mankind: those who call
upon his name shall be saved. Buddha is born of a virgin; his
name means the Word, the Logos, but he is known more tenderly
as the Saviour of Man; he embarrasses his teachers, when
a child, by his understanding and his answers; he is tempted in
the wilderness, when older; he goes with his apostles to redeem
the world; he abolishes caste and cruelty, and teaches forgiveness;
he receives among his followers outcasts whom Pharisaic
pride despises, and he only says, &ldquo;My law is a law of mercy to
all.&rdquo; Slain by enemies, he descends into hell, rising without
tasting death, and still lives to make intercession for man.</p>

<p>These are the recognized properties of religious tradition; the
beautiful garments belong not to the individual, but the race. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
is the drawback on all human greatness that it makes itself deified.
Even of Jesus it was said sincerely by the Platonic philosopher
Porphyry, &ldquo;That noble soul, who has ascended into heaven, has by
a certain fatality become an occasion of error.&rdquo; The inequality of
gifts is a problem not yet solved, and there is always a craving for
some miracle to explain it. Men set up their sublime representatives
as so many spiritual athletes, and measure them. &ldquo;See,
this one is six inches taller; those six inches prove him divine.&rdquo;
But because men surpass us, or surpass everybody, shall we hold
them separate from the race? Construct the race as you will,
somebody must stand at the head, in virtue as in intellect. Shall
we deify Shakespeare? Because we may begin upon his treasury
of wisdom almost before we enjoy any other book, and can
hold to it longer, and read it all our lives, from those earnest
moments when we demand the very core of thought, down to
moments of sickness and sadness when nothing else captivates;
because we may go the rounds of all literature, and grow surfeited
with every other great author, and learn a dozen languages and a
score of philosophical systems, and travel the wide world over,
and come back to Shakespeare at length, fresh as ever, and
begin at the beginning of his infinite meanings once more,&mdash;are
we therefore to consider him as separated from mortality?
Are we to raise him to the heavens, as in the magnificent eulogium
of Keats, who heads creation with &ldquo;things real, as sun,
stars, and passages of Shakespeare&rdquo;? Or are we to erect into
a creed the bold words I once heard an enthusiast soberly say,
&ldquo;that it is impossible to think of Shakespeare as a man&rdquo;? Or
shall we reverently own, that, as man&rsquo;s humility first bids him
separate himself from these his great superiors, so his faith and
hope bring him back to them and renew the tie. It paralyzes
my intellect if I doubt whether Shakespeare was a man; it paralyzes
my whole spiritual nature if I doubt whether Jesus was.</p>

<p>Therefore I believe that all religion is natural, all revealed.
What faith in humanity springs up, what trust in God, when one
recognizes the sympathy of religions! Every race believes in a
Creator and Governor of the world, in whom devout souls recognize
a Father also. Every race believes in immortality.
Every race recognizes in its religious precepts the brotherhood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
of man. The whole gigantic system of caste in Hindostan has
grown up in defiance of the Vedas, which are now being invoked
to abolish them. The Heetopades of Vishnu Sarman forbid
caste. &ldquo;Is this one of our tribe or a stranger? is the calculation
of the narrow-minded; but, to those of a noble disposition,
the earth itself is but one family.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is religion?&rdquo; says
elsewhere the same book, and answers, &ldquo;Tenderness toward all
creatures.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is my beloved of whom mankind are not
afraid and who of mankind is not afraid,&rdquo; says the Bhagvat
Geeta. &ldquo;Kesava is pleased with him who does good to others,
... who is always desirous of the welfare of all creatures,&rdquo; says
the Vishnu Purana. In Confucius it is written, &ldquo;My doctrine is
simple and easy to understand;&rdquo; and his chief disciple adds,
&ldquo;It consists only in having the heart right and in loving one&rsquo;s
neighbor as one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo; When he was asked, &ldquo;Is there one
word which may serve as a rule of practice for all one&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;Is not &lsquo;Reciprocity&rsquo; such a word? What you
wish done to yourself, do to others.&rdquo; By some translators the
rule is given in a negative form, in which it is also found in the
Jewish Talmud (Rabbi Hillel), &ldquo;Do not to another what thou
wouldst not he should do to thee; this is the sum of the law.&rdquo;
So Thales, when asked for a rule of life, taught, &ldquo;That which
thou blamest in another, do not thyself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself,&rdquo; said the Hebrew book of Leviticus. Iamblichus
tells us that Pythagoras taught &ldquo;the love of all to all.&rdquo;
&ldquo;To live is not to live for one&rsquo;s self alone, let us help one another,&rdquo;
said the Greek dramatist Menander; and the Roman
dramatist Terence, following him, brought down the applause of
the whole theatre by the saying, &ldquo;I am a man; I count nothing
human foreign to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give bread to a stranger,&rdquo; said Quintilian,
&ldquo;in the name of the universal brotherhood which binds
together all men under the common father of nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;What
good man will look on any suffering as foreign to himself?&rdquo; said
the Latin satirist Juvenal. &ldquo;This sympathy is what distinguishes
us from brutes,&rdquo; he adds. The poet Lucan predicted a
time when warlike weapons should be laid aside, and all men
love one another. &ldquo;Nature has inclined us to love men,&rdquo; said
Cicero, &ldquo;and this is the foundation of the law.&rdquo; He also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
described his favorite virtue of justice as &ldquo;devoting itself wholly to
the good of others.&rdquo; Seneca said, &ldquo;We are members of one
great body, Nature planted in us a mutual love, and fitted us
for a social life. We must consider that we were born for the
good of the whole.&rdquo; &ldquo;Love mankind,&rdquo; wrote Marcus Antoninus,
summing it all up in two words; while the loving soul of
Epictetus extended the sphere of mutual affection beyond this
earth, holding that &ldquo;the universe is but one great city, full of
beloved ones, divine and human, by nature endeared to each
other.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>This sympathy of religions extends even to the loftiest virtues,&mdash;the
forgiveness of injuries, the love of enemies and the
overcoming of evil with good. &ldquo;The wise man,&rdquo; said the
Chinese Lao-tse, &ldquo;avenges his injuries with benefits.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hatred,&rdquo;
says a Buddhist sacred book, the Dhammapada, &ldquo;does
not cease by hatred at any time; hatred ceases by love; this is
the eternal rule.&rdquo; &ldquo;To overcome evil with good is good, and to
resist evil by evil is evil,&rdquo; says a Mohammedan manual of ethics.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
&ldquo;Turn not away from a sinner, but look on him with compassion,&rdquo;
says Saadi&rsquo;s Gulistan. &ldquo;If thine enemy hunger, give him
bread to eat; if he thirst, give him water to drink,&rdquo; said the
Hebrew proverb. &ldquo;He who commits injustice is ever made
more wretched than he who suffers it,&rdquo; said Plato, and adds, &ldquo;It
is never right to return an injury.&rdquo; &ldquo;No one will dare maintain,&rdquo;
said Aristotle, &ldquo;that it is better to do injustice than to bear
it.&rdquo; &ldquo;We should do good to our enemy,&rdquo; said Cleobulus, &ldquo;and
make him our friend.&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak not evil to a friend, nor even
to an enemy,&rdquo; said Pittacus, one of the Seven Wise Men. &ldquo;It
is more beautiful,&rdquo; said Valerius Maximus, &ldquo;to overcome injury
by the power of kindness than to oppose to it the obstinacy of
hatred.&rdquo; Maximus Tyrius has a special chapter on the treatment
of injuries, and concludes: &ldquo;If he who injures does
wrong, he who returns the injury does equally wrong.&rdquo; Plutarch,
in his essay, &ldquo;How to profit by our enemies,&rdquo; bids us
sympathize with them in affliction and aid their needs. &ldquo;A
philosopher, when smitten, must love those who smite him, as
if he were the father, the brother, of all men,&rdquo; said Epictetus.
&ldquo;It is peculiar to man,&rdquo; said Marcus Antoninus, &ldquo;to love even
those who do wrong.... Ask thyself daily to how many ill-minded
persons thou hast shown a kind disposition.&rdquo; He compares
the wise and humane soul to a spring of pure water which
blesses even him who curses it; and the Oriental story likens
such a soul to the sandal-wood tree, which imparts its fragrance
even to the axe that cuts it down.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
How it cheers and enlarges us to hear of these great
thoughts and know that the Divine has never been without a
witness on earth! How it must sadden the soul to disbelieve
them. Worse yet to be in a position where one has to hope
that they may not be correctly reported,&mdash;that one by one they
may be explained away. A prosecuting attorney once told me
that the most painful part of his position was that he had to
hope that every man he prosecuted would be proved a villain.
What is the painful circumstance in Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s Byron
controversy? That she is obliged to hope that the character
of a sister woman, hitherto stainless, may be hopelessly
blackened. But what is this to their position who are bound to
hope that the character of humanity will be blackened by
wholesale, who are compelled to resist every atom of light that
history reveals. For instance, as the great character of Buddha
has come out from the darkness, within fifty years, how these
reluctant people have struggled against it, still desiring to
escape. &ldquo;Save us, O God!&rdquo; they have seemed to say, &ldquo;from
the distress of believing that so many years ago there was
a sublime human life.&rdquo; Show such persons that the great
religious ideas and maxims are as old as literature; and
how they resist the knowledge! &ldquo;Surely it is not so bad as
that,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Is there not a possibility of a mistranslation?
Let us see the text, explore the lexicon; is there no labor, no
toil, by which we can convince ourselves that there is a mistake?
Anything rather than believe that there is a light which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For this purpose the very facts of history must be suppressed
or explained away. Sir George Mackenzie, in his &ldquo;Travels in
Iceland,&rdquo; says that the clergy prevented till 1630, with &ldquo;mistaken
zeal,&rdquo; the publication of the Scandinavian Eddas. Huc,
the Roman Catholic Missionary, described in such truthful colors
the religious influence of Buddhism in Thibet that his book was
put in the <i>index expurgatorius</i> at Rome. Balmes, a learned
Roman Catholic writer, declares that &ldquo;Christianity is stripped
of a portion of its honors&rdquo; if we trace back any high standard
of female purity to the ancient Germans; and so he coolly
sets aside as &ldquo;poetical&rdquo; the plain statements of the accurate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
Tacitus. If we are to believe the accounts given of the Jewish
Essenes by Josephus, De Quincey thinks, the claims made
by Christianity are annihilated. &ldquo;If Essenism could make
good its pretensions, there, at one blow, would be an end of
Christianity, which, in that case, is not only superseded as an
idle repetition of a religious system already published, but as a
criminal plagiarism. Nor can the wit of man evade the conclusion.&rdquo;
He accordingly attempts to explain away the testimony
of Josephus.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>And what makes this exclusiveness the more repulsive is its
modernness. Paul himself quoted from the sublime hymn of
Cleanthes to prove to the Greeks that they too recognized the
Fatherhood of God. The early Christian apologists, living face
to face with the elder religions, made no exclusive claims. Tertullian
declared the soul to be an older authority than prophecy,
and its voice the gift of God from the beginning. Justin
Martyr said, &ldquo;Those who live according to Reason are Christians,
though you may call them atheists.... Such among the
Greeks were Socrates and Heraclitus and the rest. They who
have made or do make Reason (Logos) their rule of life are
Christians and men without fear and trembling.&rdquo; &ldquo;The same
God,&rdquo; said Clement, &ldquo;to whom we owe the Old and New Testaments
gave also to the Greeks their Greek philosophy by which
the Almighty is glorified among the Greeks.&rdquo; Lactantius declared
that the ancient philosophers &ldquo;attained the full truth and
the whole mystery of religion.&rdquo; &ldquo;One would suppose,&rdquo; said
Minucius Felix, &ldquo;either that the Christians were philosophers,
or the philosophers Christians.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is now called the
Christian religion,&rdquo; said Augustine, &ldquo;has existed among the ancients,
and was not absent from the beginning of the human
race, until Christ came in the flesh; from which time the true
religion, which existed already, began to be called Christian.&rdquo;
Jerome said that &ldquo;the knowledge of God was present by nature

in all, nor was there any one born without God, or who had not
in himself the seeds of all virtues.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>How few modern sects reach even this point of impartiality!
The usual course of theologians is to deny, and to deny with
fury, that any such sympathy of religions exists. &ldquo;There never
was a time,&rdquo; says a distinguished European preacher, &ldquo;when
there did not exist an infinite gulf between the ideas of the
ancients and the ideas of Christianity. There is an end of
Christianity if men agree in thinking the contrary.&rdquo; And an
eminent Unitarian preacher in America, Rev. A. P. Peabody,
says, &ldquo;If the truths of Christianity are intuitive and self-evident,
how is it that they formed no part of any man&rsquo;s consciousness
till the advent of Christ?&rdquo; How can any one look
history in the face, how can any man open even the dictionary
of any ancient language, and yet say this? What word sums
up the highest Christian virtue if not <em>philanthropy</em>? And
yet the word is a Greek word, and was used in the same sense
before Christendom existed.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
Fortunately there have always been men whose larger minds
could adapt themselves to the truth instead of narrowing the
truth to them. In William Penn&rsquo;s &ldquo;No Cross No Crown,&rdquo; one-half
the pages are devoted to the religious testimony of Christians,
and one-half to that of the non-Christian world. The
writings of the most learned of English Catholics, Digby, are a
treasure-house of ancient religion, and the conflict between the
bigot and the scholar makes him deliciously inconsistent. He
states a doctrine, illustrates it from the schoolmen or the
fathers, proudly claims it as being monopolized by the Christian
church, and ends by citing a parallel passage from Plato or
&AElig;schylus! &ldquo;The ancient poets,&rdquo; he declares, &ldquo;seem never to
have conceived the idea of a spirit of resignation which would
sanctify calamity;&rdquo; and accordingly he quotes Aristotle&rsquo;s assertion,
that &ldquo;suffering becomes beautiful when any one bears
great calamities with cheerfulness, not through insensibility, but
through greatness of mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is not a passage in the
classics,&rdquo; he declares, &ldquo;which recognizes the beauty of holiness
and Christian mildness;&rdquo; and in the next breath he remarks,
that Homer&rsquo;s description of Patroclus furnishes <ins class="correction" title="omitted from original">&ldquo;</ins>language which
might convey an idea of that mildness of manner which belonged
to men in Christian ages.&rdquo; And he closes his eloquent picture
of the faith of the middle ages in immortality by attributing to
the monks and friars the dying language of Socrates, that &ldquo;a
man who has spent his life in the study of philosophy ought to
take courage in his death, and to be full of hope that he is about
to possess the greatest good that can be obtained, which will be
in his possession as soon as he dies;&rdquo; and much more of that
serene and sublime wisdom. Yet all this is done in a manner
so absolutely free from sophistry, the conflict between the
scholar and the churchman is so innocent and transparent, that
one forgives it in Digby. In most writers on these subjects
there is greater bigotry, without the learning which in his case
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
makes it endurable, because it supplies the means for its own
correction.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>And, if it is thus hard to do historical justice, it is far harder
to look with candor upon contemporary religions. Thus the Jesuit
Father Ripa thought that Satan had created the Buddhist religion
on purpose to bewilder the Christian church. There we see
a creed possessing more votaries than any in the world, numbering
nearly one-third of the human race. Its traditions go back
to a founder whose record is stainless and sublime. It has the
doctrine of the Real Presence, the Madonna and Child, the invocation
of the dead, monasteries and pilgrimages, celibacy and tonsure,
relics, rosaries, and holy water. Wherever it has spread, it
has broken down the barrier of caste. It teaches that all men
are brethren, and makes them prove it by their acts; it diffuses
gentleness and self-sacrificing benevolence. &ldquo;It has become,&rdquo;
as Neander admits, &ldquo;to many tribes of people a means of transition
from the wildest barbarism to semi-civilization.&rdquo; Tennent,
living amid the lowest form of it in Ceylon, says that its code
of morals is &ldquo;second only to that of Christianity itself,&rdquo; and
enjoins &ldquo;every conceivable virtue and excellence.&rdquo; It is coming
among us, represented by many of the Chinese, and a San-Francisco
merchant, a Christian of the Episcopal Church, told me
that, on conversing with their educated men, he found in them a
religious faith quite as enlightened as his own. Shall we not
rejoice in this consoling discovery? &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the simple-hearted
Abb&eacute; Huc: so he published his account of Buddhism,
and saw it excommunicated. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Father Ripa, &ldquo;it is
the invention of the devil!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>With a steady wave of progress Mohammedanism is sweeping
through Africa, where Christianity scarcely advances a step.
Wherever Mohammedanism reaches, schools and libraries are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
established, gambling and drunkenness cease, theft and falsehood
diminish, polygamy is limited, woman begins to be elevated
and has property rights guaranteed; and, instead of witnessing
human sacrifices, you see the cottager reading the Koran at her
door, like the Christian cottager in Cowper&rsquo;s description. &ldquo;Its
gradual extension,&rdquo; says an eye-witness, &ldquo;is gradually but surely
modifying the negro.... Within the last half century the humanizing
influence of the Koran is acknowledged by all who are
acquainted with the interior tribes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> So in India, Mohammedanism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
makes converts by thousands (according to Col. Sleeman,
than whom there can be no more intelligent authority) where
Christianity makes but a handful; and this, he testifies, because
in Mohammedanism there is no spirit of caste, while Christians
have a caste of their own, and will not put converts on an equality.
Do we rejoice in this great work of progress? No! one
would think we were still in the time of the crusades by the way
we ignore the providential value of Mohammedanism.</p>

<p>The one unpardonable sin is exclusiveness. Any form of religion
is endangered when we bring it to the test of facts; for
none on earth can bear that test. There never existed a person,
nor a book, nor an institution, which did not share the merits
and the drawbacks of its rivals. Granting all that can be
established as to the debt of the world to the very best dispensation,
the fact still remains, that there is not a single maxim, nor
idea, nor application, nor triumph, that any single religion can
claim as exclusively its own. Neither faith, nor love, nor truth,
nor disinterestedness, nor forgiveness, nor patience, nor peace,
nor equality, nor education, nor missionary effort, nor prayer,
nor honesty, nor the sentiment of brotherhood, nor reverence
for woman, nor the spirit of humility, nor the fact of martyrdom,
nor any other good thing, is monopolized by any one or any
half dozen forms of faith. All religions recognize, more or less
distinctly, these principles; all do something to exemplify, something
to dishonor them. Travelers find virtue in a seeming minority
in all other countries, and forget that they have left it in
a minority at home. A Hindoo girl, astonished at the humanity
of a British officer toward her father, declared her surprise that
any one could display so much kindness who did not believe in
the god Vishnu. Gladwin, in his &ldquo;Persian Classics,&rdquo; narrates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
a scene which occurred in his presence between a Jew and a
Mohammedan. The Mohammedan said in wrath, &ldquo;If this deed
of conveyance is not authentic, may God cause me to die a Jew.&rdquo;
The Jew said, &ldquo;I make my oath on the Pentateuch, and if I
swear falsely I am a Mohammedan like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What religion stands highest in moral results if not Christianity?
Yet the slave-trader belongs to Christendom as well
as the saint. If we say that Christendom was not truly represented
by the slaves in the hold of John Newton&rsquo;s slave-ship,
but only by the prayers which he read every day, as he narrates,
in the cabin,&mdash;then we must admit that Buddhism is not to be
judged merely by the prostrations before Fo, but by the learning
of its lamaseries and the beneficence of its people. The
reformed Brahmoes of India complain that Christian nations
force alcoholic drinks on their nation, despite their efforts; and
the greater humanity of Hindoos towards animals has been,
according to Dr. Hedge, a serious embarrassment to our missionaries.
So men interrupt the missionaries in China, according
to Coffin&rsquo;s late book, by asking them why, if their doctrines
be true, Christian nations forced opium on an unwilling emperor,
who refused to the last to receive money from the traffic?
What a history has been our treatment of the American Indians?
&ldquo;Instead of virtues,&rdquo; said Cadwallader Colden, writing as
early as 1727, &ldquo;we have taught them vices that they were entirely
free from before that time.&rdquo; The delegation from the
Society of Friends reported last year that an Indian chief
brought a young Indian before a white commissioner to give
evidence, and the commissioner hesitated a little in receiving a
part of the testimony, when the chief said with great emphasis,
&ldquo;Oh! you may believe what he says: he tells the truth:
<em>he has never seen a white man before</em>!&rdquo; In Southey&rsquo;s Wesley
there is an account of an Indian whom Wesley met in Georgia,
and who thus summed up his objections to Christianity: &ldquo;Christian
much drunk! Christian beat man! Christian tell lies!
Devil Christian! Me no Christian!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> What then? All other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
religions show the same disparity between belief and practice,
and each is safe till it tries to exclude the rest. Test each sect
by its best or its worst as you will, by its high-water mark of virtue
or its low-water mark of vice. But falsehood begins when
you measure the ebb of any other religion against the flood-tide
of your own.</p>

<p>There is a noble and a base side to every history. The
same religion varies in different soils. Christianity is not the
same in England and in Italy; in Armenia and in Ethiopia; in
the Protestant and Catholic cantons of Switzerland; in Massachusetts,
in Georgia, and in Utah. Neither is Buddhism the
same in China, in Thibet and in Ceylon; nor Mohammedanism
in Turkey and in Persia. We have no right to pluck the best
fruit from one tree, the worst from another, and then say that
the tree is known by its fruits. I say again, Christianity has,
on the whole, produced the highest results of all, in manners,
in arts, in energy. Yet when Christianity had been five centuries
in the world, the world&rsquo;s only hope seemed to be in the
superior strength and purity of pagan races. &ldquo;Can we wonder,&rdquo;
wrote Salvian (A.D. 400), &ldquo;if our lands have been given
over to the barbarians by God? since that which we have polluted
by our profligacy the barbarians have cleansed by their chastity.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
At the end of its first thousand years, Christianity could
only show Europe at its lowest ebb of civilization, in a state
which Guizot calls &ldquo;death by the extinction of every faculty.&rdquo;
The barbarians had only deteriorated since their conversion;
the great empires were falling to pieces; and the only bright
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
spot in Europe was Mohammedan Spain, whose universities
taught all Christendom science, as its knights taught chivalry.
Even at the end of fifteen hundred years, the Turks,
having conquered successively Jerusalem and Constantinople,
seemed altogether the most powerful nation of the world; their
empire was compared to the Roman empire; they were gaining
all the time. You will find everywhere, in Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;Table-talk&rdquo;
for instance, how weak Christendom seemed against them
in the middle of the sixteenth century; and Lord Bacon, yet
later, describes them in his &ldquo;Essays&rdquo; as the only warlike nation
in Europe, except the Spaniards. But the art of printing had
been discovered, and that other new world, America; the study
of Greek literature was reviving the intellect of Europe, and
the tide had begun to turn. For four hundred years it has been
safe for Christendom to be boastful, but, if at any time during
the fifteen hundred years previous the comparison had been
made, the boasting would have been the other way. It is
unsafe to claim a monopoly of merit on the basis of facts that
cover four centuries out of nineteen. Let us not be misled by
a hasty vanity, lest some new incursion of barbarians teach us,
as it taught the early Christians, to be humble.</p>

<p>We see what Christianity has done for Europe; but we do
not remember how much Europe has done for Christianity.
Take away the influence of race and climate; take away Greek
literature and Mohammedan chivalry and the art of printing;
set the decline of Christianity in Asia and Africa against its
gain in Europe and America,&mdash;and whatever superiority may
be left is not enough on which to base exclusive claims.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
recent scientific advances of the age are a brilliant theme for the
rhetorician; but those who make these advances are the last
men to ascribe them to the influence of any exclusive religion.</p>

<p>Indeed it is only very lately that the claim of superiority in
civilization and the arts of life has been made in behalf of Christianity.
Down to the time of the Reformation it was usual to
contrast the intellectual and practical superiority of the heathen
with the purely spiritual claims of the church. &ldquo;The church has
always been accustomed,<ins class="correction" title="omitted in original">&rdquo;</ins> says the Roman Catholic Digby, &ldquo;to
see genius and learning in the ranks opposed to her.&rdquo; &ldquo;From
the beginning of the world,&rdquo; said Luther, &ldquo;there have always
been among the heathens higher and rarer people, of greater
and more exalted understanding, more excellent diligence and
skill in all arts, than among Christians, or the people of God.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do we excel in intellect, in learning, in decency of morals?&rdquo;
said Melancthon. &ldquo;By no means. But we excel in the true
knowledge and worship and adoration of God.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>Historically, of course, we are Christians, and can enjoy the
advantage which that better training has given, just as the
favored son of a king may enjoy his special advantages and yet
admit that the less favored are equally sons. The name of
Christianity only ceases to excite respect when it is used to represent
any false or exclusive claims, or when it takes the place
of the older and grander words, &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Virtue.&rdquo;
When we fully comprehend the sympathy of religions we shall
deal with other faiths on equal terms. We shall cease trying
to free men from one superstition by inviting them into another.
The true missionaries are the men inside each religion who have
outgrown its limitations. But no Christian missionary has ever
yet consented to meet the men of other religions upon the common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
ground of Theism. In Bishop Heber&rsquo;s time, the Hindoo
reformer Swaamee Narain was teaching purity and peace, the
unity of God, and the abolition of castes. Many thousands of
men followed his teachings, and whole villages and districts
were raised from the worst immorality by his labors, as the
Bishop himself bears witness. But the good Bishop seems to
have despaired of him as soon as Swaamee Narain refused conversion
to Christianity, making the objection that God was not
incarnated in one man, but in many. Then came Ram Mohun
Roy, forty years ago, and argued from the Vedas against idolatry,
caste, and the burning of widows. He also refused to be
called a Christian, and the missionaries denounced him. Now
comes Keshub Chunder Sen, with his generous utterances:
&ldquo;We profess the universal and absolute religion, whose cardinal
doctrines are the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of
Man, and which accepts the truths of all scriptures, and honors
the prophets of all nations.&rdquo; The movement reaches thousands
whom no foreign influence could touch; yet the Methodist missionaries
denounce it in the name of Christ, and even the little
Unitarian mission opens against it a battery of a single gun.
It is the same with our treatment of the Jews. According to
Bayard Taylor, Christendom converts annually three or four
Jews in Jerusalem, at a cost of $20,000 each. Nothing has been
more criticised in the course of the Free Religious Association
than its admission of Jews as equals on its platform; and yet
the reformed Jews in America have already gone in advance of
the most liberal Christian sects in their width of religious sympathy.
&ldquo;The happiness of man,&rdquo; says Rabbi Wise, in speaking
for them, &ldquo;depends on no creed and no book; it depends on the
dominion of truth, which is the Redeemer and Savior, the Messiah
and the King of Glory.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
It is our happiness to live in a time when all religions are at
last outgrowing their mythologies, and emancipated men are
stretching out their hands to share together &ldquo;the luxury of a
religion that does not degrade.&rdquo; The progressive Brahmoes of
India, the Jewish leaders in America, the Free Religious Association
among ourselves, are teaching essentially the same principles,
seeking the same ends. The Jewish congregations in
Baltimore were the first to contribute for the education of the
freedmen; the Buddhist Temple, in San Francisco, was the first
edifice of that city draped in mourning after the murder of President
Lincoln; the Parsees of the East sent contributions to the
Sanitary Commission. The great religions of the world are but
larger sects; they come together, like the lesser sects, for works
of benevolence; they share the same aspirations, and every step
in the progress of each brings it nearer to all the rest. For us,
the door out of superstition and sin may be called Christianity;
that is an historical name only, the accident of a birthplace.
But other nations find other outlets; they must pass through
their own doors, not through ours; and all will come at last
upon the broad ground of God&rsquo;s providing, which bears no
man&rsquo;s name. The reign of heaven on earth will not be called
the Kingdom of Christ nor of Buddha,&mdash;it will be called the
Church of God, or the Commonwealth of Man. I do not wish
to belong to a religion only, but to <em>the</em> religion; it must not include
less than the piety of the world.</p>

<p>If one insists on being exclusive, where shall he find a home?
What hold has any Protestant sect among us on a thoughtful
mind? They are too little, too new, too inconsistent, too feeble.
What are these children of a day compared with that magnificent
Church of Rome, which counts its years by centuries, and its
votaries by millions, and its martyrs by myriads; with kings for
confessors and nations for converts; carrying to all the earth
one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and claiming for itself no less
title than the Catholic, the Universal? Yet in conversing with
Catholics one is again repelled by the extreme juvenility, and
modernness, and scanty numbers of their church. It is the superb
elder brother of our little sects, doubtless, and seems to
have most of the family fortune. But the whole fortune is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
so small! and even the elder brother is so young! Even the
Romanist ignores traditions more vast, antiquity more remote, a
literature of piety more grand. His temple suffocates: give us
a shrine still vaster; something than this Catholicism more
catholic; not the Church of Rome, but of God and Man; a
Pantheon, not a Parthenon; the true <i>semper, ubique, et ab omnibus</i>,
the Religion of the Ages, Natural Religion.</p>

<p>I was once in a foreign cathedral when, after the three days
of mourning, in Holy Week, came the final day of Hallelujah.
The great church had looked dim and sad, with the innumerable
windows closely curtained, since the moment when the symbolical
bier of Jesus was borne to its symbolical tomb beneath the
High Altar, while the three mystic candles blazed above it.
There had been agony and beating of cheeks in the darkness,
while ghostly processions moved through the aisles, and fearful
transparencies were unrolled from the pulpit. The priests
kneeled in <ins class="correction" title="gorgeeous in original">gorgeous</ins> robes, chanting, with their heads resting
on the altar steps; the multitude hung expectant on their
words. Suddenly burst forth a new chant, &ldquo;Gloria in Excelsis!&rdquo;
In that instant every curtain was rolled aside, the
cathedral was bathed in glory, the organs clashed, the bells
chimed, flowers were thrown from the galleries, little birds were
let loose, friends embraced and greeted one another, and we
looked down upon a tumultuous sea of faces, all floating in a
sunlit haze. And yet, I thought, the whole of this sublime
transformation consisted in letting in the light of day! These
priests and attendants, each stationed at his post, had only
removed the darkness they themselves had made. Unveil these
darkened windows, but remove also these darkening walls; the
temple itself is but a lingering shadow of that gloom. Instead
of its coarse and stifling incense, give us God&rsquo;s pure air, and
teach us that the broadest religion is the best.</p>

further and further, seems destined to overpower the nations at the very
equator, if Christianity does not presently step in to dispute the ground with
it.&rdquo; He says &ldquo;that a great part of the Berbers of the desert were once
Christians, and that they afterwards changed their religion and adopted
Islam&rdquo; (I., 197, 198). He represents the slave merchants of the interior as
complaining that the Mohammedans of Tunis have abolished slavery, but
that Christians still continue it (I., 465). &ldquo;It is difficult to decide how a
Christian government is to deal with these countries, where none but Mohammedans
maintain any sort of government&rdquo; (II., 196). &ldquo;There is a vital
principle in Islam, which has only to be brought out by a reformer to accomplish
great things&rdquo; (I., 164).</p>

<p>Reade, in his Savage Africa, discusses the subject fully in a closing chapter,
and concludes thus: &ldquo;Mohammed, a servant of God, redeemed the
eastern world. His followers are now redeeming Africa.... Let us aid
the Mohammedans in their great work, the redemption of Africa.... In
every Mohammedan town there is a public school and a public library.&rdquo;
He complains that Christianity utterly fails to check theft, but <ins class="correction" title="Mohamedanism in original">Mohammedanism</ins>
stops it entirely (pp. 135, 579, English ed.).</p>

<p>For Asiatic Mohammedanism see Sleeman&rsquo;s Recollections, II., 164, and
compare Tennent&rsquo;s Christianity in Ceylon, p. 330, and Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Chips
from a German Workshop, II., 351. The London Spectator, in April, 1869,
stated that &ldquo;Mohammedanism gains thousands of converts every year,&rdquo;
and thus described the activity of its organization, the statement being condensed
in the Boston Journal: &ldquo;Of all these societies, the largest, the most
powerful, the most widely diffused, is the Mohammedan population. Everywhere
it has towns, villages, temples, places within which no infidel foot ever
is or can be set. Its missionaries wander everywhere, keeping up the flame
of Islam,&mdash;the hope that the day is coming, <ins class="correction" title="s in original">is</ins> at hand, when the white curs
shall pass away, and the splendid throne which Timour won for the faithful
shall again be theirs. They have their own papers, their own messengers,
their own mail carriers, and they trust no other. Repeatedly, before the
telegraph was established, their agents outstripped the fastest couriers the
government could employ. The government express was carried by Mussulmans,
who allowed the private messengers to get on a few hours ahead.
Every dervish, moollah, or missionary, is a secret agent. This organization,
which has always existed, has of late been drawn closer, partly as the result
of their great mutiny, which taught the priests their hold over the soldiery,
partly by the expiration of the &lsquo;century of expiation,&rsquo; and partly by the marvelous
revival of the Puritan element in Mohammedanism itself.&rdquo;</p>

from this book (as from other witnesses), that one of the worst crimes now
practiced by the Indians has sprung up since that day, being apparently
stimulated by the brutalities practiced by whites towards Indian women.

&ldquo;Neither history nor more recent experience can furnish any example
of the long retention of pure Christianity by a people themselves rude and
unenlightened. In all the nations of Europe, embracing every period since
the second century, Christianity must be regarded as having taken the hue
and complexion of the social state with which it was incorporated, presenting
itself unsullied, contaminated, or corrupted, in sympathy with the enlightenment
